/* Explanation of Code:
    1. The function maximumWealth takes a 2D vector of integers accounts as input and returns an integer representing the maximum wealth among all the account holders.
    2. It declares a variable ans initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum wealth.
    3. It enters a range-based loop that iterates through the elements of accounts, which are themselves vectors of integers representing the wealth of individual account holders. The loop variable is a reference to a vector of integers named v.
    4. For each iteration of the loop, it calculates the sum of the elements of v using the accumulate function and updates ans with the maximum of ans and the sum.
    5. After the loop finishes executing, the function returns the value of ans.
